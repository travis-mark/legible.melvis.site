# Legible

[Legible](https://legible.melvis.site) is an attempt to combine [create-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte) with [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) to build a better site template for my experiments.

Because the site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, run `npm run pages:dev` will run a local server and `npm run pages:deploy` makes changes public.
